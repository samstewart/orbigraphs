\begin{abstract}
Riemannian orbifolds are a slight generalization of Riemannian manifolds.  Instead of being locally diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$, Riemannian orbifolds are locally diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ modulo the isometric action of a finite group.  Recently, a number of authors have examined orbifolds from the perspective of inverse spectral geometry.  In light of the strong connection between spectral geometry and spectral graph theory, our project defines a graph theoretic parallel of an orbifold, called an orbigraph, and obtains spectral results about orbigraphs.  The graph theoretic analogue of a manifold is taken to be a $k$-regular graph.  Because the local structure of a $k$-regular graph is a $k$-star, we form a $k$-orbigraph by patching together quotients of $k$-stars.  The resulting class of objects (the $k$-orbigraphs) consists of directed multigraphs satisfying certain outdegree conditions.  The spectrum of the adjacency matrix of a $k$-orbigraph yields bounds on the number of singular (non $k$-star) vertices present in the orbigraph.  The reversibility (as in Markov chains) of an orbigraph determines if it can be obtained as the quotient of a finite $k$-regular graph.  Our methods include computational algorithms and formal graph theoretic arguments.  Both the definition of an orbigraph and our results about them are new.

  \subsection{Notation}
  Let $\Gamma$ be a graph, possibly directed with multiple edges. Its vertex set will be denoted $V(\Gamma)$ and its edge set $E(\Gamma)$. Furthermore, if $u, v \in V(\Gamma)$, then $w_\Gamma(u, v)$ will denote the number of edges from $u$ to $v$. In cases when the context is clear, this notation may be abbreviated to $w(u,v)$. Then for an enumeration $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ of $V(\Gamma)$, the adjacency matrix $A(\Gamma)$ is given by $A(\Gamma)_{ij} = w_\Gamma(v_i, v_j)$. If $e \in E(\Gamma)$ then $o(e)$ denotes the origin of the edge and $t(e)$ denotes its terminus. A walk in $\Gamma$ is a sequence of edges $e_1,\ldots,e_n$ such that $t(e_i) = o(e_{i+1})$ for $1 \le i < n$. A walk is closed if $o(e_1) = t(e_n)$. A closed walk may be referred to as a loop at $o(e_1)$.

  Also, note that the adjacency matrix can be viewed as a linear operator on the function space $\mathbb{C}^{V(\Gamma)}$. This operator will be denoted $A_\Gamma$ and is defined for $\psi \in \mathbb{C}^V(\Gamma)$ and $v \in V(\Gamma)$ by
  $$
    [A_\Gamma \psi](v) = \sum_{u \in V(\Gamma)} w(v, u)\psi(u).

\section{Defining Orbigraphs as Analogs of Orbifolds}

  Reasons for choices, etc.

  \begin{definition}\label{def:OrbigraphDefn}
    A \textbf{$k$-orbigraph} is a directed graph $\Gamma$ where the adjacency matrix $A(\Gamma)$ satisfies the following:
    
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
      \item $A(\Gamma)_{ij} \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$
      \item $\sum_j A(\Gamma)_{ij} = k$
      \item $A(\Gamma)_{ij} > 0$ if and only if $A(\Gamma)_{ji} > 0$.
    \end{enumerate}

  \end{definition}

  \subsection{Covering Theory for Orbigraphs}

    Start with covering theory because it lets us characterize orbigraphs as quotients of $k$-trees by equitable partitions.

    \begin{definition}\label{def:EqPartitionDefn}
      Let $\Gamma$ be an orbigraph and $\pi = \{ \pi_1, \ldots, \pi_m \}$ be a partition of its vertices. Then $\pi$ is an \textbf{equitable partition} if for $v \in \pi_i$, the number $A(\Gamma / \pi)_{ij} = \sum_{u \in \pi_j} w(v, u)$ is independent of the choice of $v$. The multi-digraph with adjacency matrix $A(\Gamma / \pi)$ is called the \textbf{quotient graph}.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{lemma}\label{lemma:EqPartitionQuotient}
      If $\Gamma$ is an $k$-orbigraph and $\pi$ is an equitable partition of $\Gamma$, then $\Gamma / \pi$ is a $k$-orbigraph.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      Because $\Gamma$ is an orbigraph, we have $w_\Gamma(v, u) \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ for all $u, v \in V(\Gamma)$. Hence, $A(\Gamma / \pi)_{ij} = \sum_{u \in \pi_j} w_\Gamma(v, u) \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ for any $v \in \pi_i$. Now let $v \in \pi_i$ so we have
      
      \begin{align*}
        \sum_j A(\Gamma / \pi)_{ij} &= \sum_j \sum_{u \in \pi_j} w_\Gamma(v, u) \\
        &= \sum_{u \in \Gamma} w_\Gamma(v, u) = k.
      \end{align*}

      Finally, assume that $A(\Gamma / \pi)_{ij} > 0$. Then there must be a $u \in \pi_j$ for some $j$ such that $w_\Gamma(v, u) > 0$. Because $\Gamma$ is an orbigraph, we must have $w_\Gamma(u, v) > 0$. Thus $A(\Gamma / \pi)_{ji} > 0$.
    \end{proof}

    We say that an orbigraph $\Gamma_1$ covers an orbigraph $\Gamma_2$ if there is an equitable partition $\pi$ of $\Gamma$ such that $\Gamma_1 / \pi = \Gamma_2$.

    \begin{lemma}\label{lemma:CoveringTransitivity}
      The covering relation is transitive.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      We wish to show that if $\Gamma_1$ is an orbigraph with equitable partition $\pi_1$ such that $\Gamma_1 / \pi_1 = \Gamma_2$ and $\Gamma_2$ has an equitable parition $\pi_2$ such that $\Gamma_2 / \pi_2 = \Gamma_3$, then there is an equitable partition $\pi_1 \circ \pi_2$ of $\Gamma_1$ such that $\Gamma_1 / (\pi_1 \circ \pi_2) = \Gamma_3$. Denote the partition matrix associated with equitable partition $\pi$ by $P(\pi)$. By Lemma 2.1 (Algebraic Combinatorics, Godsil, p.77) we have that $A(\Gamma_1)P(\pi_1) = P(\pi_1)A(\Gamma_2)$ and $A(\Gamma_2)P(\pi_2) = P(\pi_2)A(\Gamma_3)$. Multiplying the first equation on the right by $P(\pi_2)$ gives
      
      \begin{align*}
        A(\Gamma_1)P(\pi_1)P(\pi_2) &= P(\pi_1)A(\Gamma_2)P(\pi_2) \\
        &= P(\pi_1)P(\pi_2)A(\Gamma_3).
      \end{align*}

      Thus the matrix $X = P(\pi_1)P(\pi_2)$ is such that $A(\Gamma_1) X = X A(\Gamma_3)$. Thus by the converse of Godsil's Lemma 2.1 we have that $X$ is a equitable partition matrix of $\Gamma_1$ with quotient orbigraph $\Gamma_3$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:UniversalCovers}
      Every connected $k$-orbigraph is covered by the $k$-tree and disconnected orbigraphs are covered by disjoint unions of $k$-trees.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
      It suffices to prove the result in the connected case, as the full result follows by induction. Let $\Gamma$ be the connected $k$-orbigraph in question. Choose a mapping $e \mapsto \rev{e}$ on the edge set of $\Gamma$ such that if $o(e) = a$ and $t(e) = b$ then $o(\rev{e}) = b$ and $t(\rev{e}) = a$. Such a function must exist by condition (iii) of the definition of an orbigraph. Define an equivalence relation on the set of walks in $\Gamma$ such that two walks are equivalent if they can be made the same by adding or removing pairs of edges of the form $e\rev{e}$. Define a new graph $T$ as follows. Let $V(T)$ be the collection of equivalence classes of walks under this relation. Then $E(T)$ consists of all pairs of elements $(w_1, w_2)$ of $V(T)$ such that $w_2$ is equivalent to the result of appending a single edge to $w_1$. Now I claim that $T$ is a $k$-tree and the partition of the vertices of $T$ according to their terminus as walks in $\Gamma$ is an equitable.

      To see that $T$ is a $k$-tree, note that each walk $w$ in $\Gamma$ can be extended by one edge in $k$ ways; however, exactly one of these extensions will be the inverse of the last edge of the walk. Therefore, there are $k-1$ edges in $T$ of the form $(w, w')$ where $w'$ is one edge longer than $w$ and $1$ edge of the form $(w'', w)$ where $w''$ is one edge shorter than $w$. Hence each vertex $w \in T$ has degree $k$. Furthermore, because each edge in $T$ is of the form $(w_1, w_2)$ where $w_2$ is one edge longer than $w_1$, there can be no cycles in $T$. Hence $T$ is a $k$-tree.

      Finally, consider the partition $\pi$ of $V(T)$ according to the terminus function. Let $w \in \pi_i$ and consider $\sum_{u \in \pi_j} w_T(w, u)$. Because $T$ does not have multiple edges, this is simply equal to the number of neighbors of $w$ in $\pi_j$. However, by definition of $\pi$, this is then equal $w_\Gamma(t(w), t(u))$ for any $u \in \pi_j$, which is clearly independent of the choice of $w$. This also shows that $T / \pi = \Gamma$, completing the proof.
      \end{proof}

    These two results imply that we can think of $k$-trees as universal covers of orbigraphs.

    Comparable to the distinction between \textbf{good} and \textbf{bad} orbi\textit{folds} [see thurston], we call an orb\textit{graph} $\Gamma$ \textbf{good} when it is covered by a \textit{finite} $k$-regular graph and we call $\Gamma$ \textbf{bad} when no finite covering exists. Of course, both good and bad orbigraphs are always covered by infinite $k$-trees as described above, again similar to the universal coverings of orbifolds. But beyond these similarities, orbigraph covering theory parts ways with orbifold covering theory: we are able to characterize good and bad orbigraph via a purely structural property.

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:GoodBadCharacterization}
      Let $\Gamma$ be an orbigraph and let $A$ be its adjacency matrix. If and only if, for a given cycle $A_{1,2} A_{2,3} \ldots A_{n-1, n} A_{n, 1}$, the corresponding reverse cycle $A_{1, n} A_{n, n-1} \ldots A_{3,2} A_{2,1}$ such that $A_{1,2} A_{2,3} \ldots A_{n-1, n} A_{n, 1} = A_{1, n} A_{n, n-1} \ldots A_{3,2} A_{2,1}$, then $\Gamma$ is good.
    \end{theorem}

    The cycle condition in Theorem \ref{thm:GoodBadCharacterization} is known as the Kolmogorov critition [cite Kemney and Snell] and is equivalent to claiming that $\Gamma$, when converted to a Markov chain by normalizing the edge weights by $k$, is reversible. We discovered the good/bad characterization via Markov chain theory and only later made the structural connection, so while the theorem uses the cycle condition for readability, the proof exploits the concept of Markov reversibility. Interested readers should consult the classic reference [Kemney and Snell] for an in-depth study of reversible chains. %FIXME - references

    \end{proof}


  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \subsection{Group Actions on Orbigraphs}

    We can also investigate the relationship between group actions and orbigraphs:

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:GroupQuotient}
      If a group $G$ acts on an orbigraph $\Gamma$ by automorphisms, then the orbits of $V(\Gamma)$ form an equitable partition.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
      Let $\pi = \{ \pi_1, \ldots, \pi_n \}$ be the partition of $V(\Gamma)$ into orbits by $G$. Then let $v, v' \in \pi_i$. Then there exists a $g \in G$ such that $g . v = v'$. Then we have
      
      \begin{align*}
        \sum_{u \in \pi_j} w_\Gamma(v, u) &= \sum_{u \in \pi_j} w_\Gamma(g^{-1}.v', u) \\
        &= \sum_{g^{-1}.u' \in \pi_j} w_\Gamma(g^{-1}.v', g^{-1}.u') \\
        &= \sum_{u' \in \pi_j} w_\Gamma(v', u') = \sum_{u \in \pi_j} w_\Gamma(v', u).
      \end{align*}

      Hence the partition $\pi$ is equitable.
    \end{proof}

    In this situation will denote the quotient $\Gamma / \pi$ by $\Gamma / G$. Note that this implies that an orbigraph is good if it is the quotient of a $k$-regular graph by a group action. We see that this group action can be lifted to the universal covering tree:

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:GoodFundamentalGroup}
      If $\Gamma$ is a connected $k$-orbigraph such that $\Gamma = \widetilde{\Gamma}/G$ for some subgroup $G$ of the automorphism group of a $k$-regular graph $\widetilde{\Gamma}$, then there exists a group of automorphisms $\widetilde{G}$ of $T_k$ such that $T_k / \widetilde{G} = \Gamma$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
      \input{GoodFundamentalGroupProof}
    \end{proof}

    Such a group may be regarded as the fundamental group of the orbigraph.

\section{Spectral properties of orbigraphs}

  Showing that spectral results about orbigraphs parallel the spectral results of manifolds and orbifolds provides excellent motivation.


  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \subsection{Familiar Spectral Results}

    Many spectral results about manifolds carry over to orbifolds, and the same is true of spectral results of regular graphs to orbigraphs. We start the discussion of the spectral theory of orbigraphs with a fundamental result.

    \begin{lemma}\label{lemma:SpectrumInclusion}
      If $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ covers $\Gamma$, then $\spec(\Gamma) \subseteq \spec(\widetilde{\Gamma})$ as multisets, with equality only when the covering is discrete.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      Let $\varphi \in \mathbb{C}^{V(\Gamma)}$. If the projection map from $\cover{\Gamma}$ to $\Gamma$ is $\phi$, then the lift of $\varphi$ is $\cover{\varphi} = \varphi \circ \phi$. We will show that $\varphi$ is an eigenvector of $A_\Gamma$ if and only if $\cover{\varphi}$ is an eigenvector of $A_{\cover{\Gamma}}$. If $A_{\cover{\Gamma}} \cover{\varphi} = \lambda \cover{\varphi}$, then for $v \in V(\cover{\Gamma})$ we have:
      \begin{align*}
        \lambda \varphi(\phi(v)) &= \lambda \cover{\varphi}(v) \\
        &= \sum_{u \in \cover{\Gamma}} w_{\cover{\Gamma}}(v, u)\cover{\varphi}(u) \\
        &= \sum_{u \in \cover{\Gamma}} w_{\cover{\Gamma}}(\phi(v), \phi(u)) \varphi(\phi(u)) \\
        &= \sum_{u \in \Gamma} w_{\cover{\Gamma}}(\phi(v), u) \varphi(u) = [A_\Gamma \varphi](\phi(v)).
      \end{align*}
      Because $\phi$ is surjective, this shows that $\varphi$ must be an eigenvector of $A_\Gamma$. On the other hand, if $A_\Gamma \varphi = \lambda \varphi$, then for $v \in V(\cover{\Gamma})$ we have:
      \begin{align*}
        [A_{\cover{\Gamma}} \cover{\varphi}](v) &= \sum_{u \in \cover{\Gamma}} w(v, u) \cover{\varphi}(u) \\
        &= \sum_{u \in \cover{\Gamma}} w(v, u) \varphi(\phi(u)) \\
        &= \sum_{u \in \cover{\Gamma}} w(\phi(v), \phi(u)) \varphi(\phi(u)) \\
        &= \sum_{u \in \Gamma} w(\phi(v), u) \varphi(u) \\
        &= \lambda \varphi(\phi(v)) = \lambda \cover{\varphi}(v).
      \end{align*}
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:SpectralRadius}
      The spectral radius of a $k$-orbigraph is $k$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
      \input{SpectralRadius}
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:LengthSpectrum}
      The spectrum of an orbigraph determines and is determined by length spectrum.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
      Let $\Gamma$ be a $k$-orbigraph, $A$ its adjacency matrix, and $\langle w_n \rangle$ a sequence of natural numbers such that $w_n$ is the number of cycles in $\Gamma$ of length $n$. We know that
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:TraceLengthSpectrum}
          w_n = Tr(A^n)
        \end{equation}
      because the diagonal of $A^n$ counts the number of cycles of length $n$. Converting $A$ to Jordon Normal Form gives
      \begin{equation*}
        Tr(\tilde{A}^n) = \sum \lambda_i^n
      \end{equation*}
      and by the similarity invariance of trace and \ref{eq:TraceLengthSpectrum}
      \begin{equation*}
        w_n = \sum \lambda_i^n
      \end{equation*}.

      Thus, the $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n$ uniquely determines the length spectrum and, conversely, by Newton's identities [Theory of equations, Uspensky] $\langle w_n \rangle$ uniquely determines $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n$.

    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:BipartiteSymmetry}
      A $k$-orbigraph is bipartite if and only if its spectrum is symmetric about zero.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
      Let $\Gamma$ be a $k$-orbigraph, $A$ its adjacency matrix, and $\tilde{A}$ the Jordon Normal Form of $A$. The diagonal of $\tilde{A}$ contains the spectrum of $\Gamma$ so
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:TraceOfJordonForm}
          Tr(\tilde{A}^n) = \sum \lambda_i^n
        \end{equation}
      We know that $Tr(A^n)$ counts the number of cycles of length $n$ and that
        \begin{equation*}
          Tr(A^n) = Tr(\tilde{A}^n) = \sum \lambda_i^n
        \end{equation*}
      by the similarity invariance of trace and \ref{eq:TraceOfJordonForm}. Recall that a graph is bipartite if it contains only even length cycles. By hypothesis, the spectrum is symmetric and thus
        \begin{equation*}
          Tr(A^m) = \sum \lambda_i^m = 0
        \end{equation*}
      for all odd $m$ which indicates that $\Gamma$ does not contain any odd length cycles. Hence, $\Gamma$ is bipartite.

      Conversely, if $\Gamma$ is bipartite then we can partition the rows and columns of $A$ intno two disjoint sets

      $$
    A = 
      \bordermatrix {
          & S & T  \cr
        S & 0 & A  \cr
        T & B & 0
      } \ \ 
      $$
      so that $S$ and $T$ have no internal connections. Choose an eigenvector of $A$

      $$
      \bordermatrix {
          & S & T  \cr
        S & 0 & A  \cr
        T & B & 0
      }
      \begin{bmatrix}
        C \cr
        D
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      \begin{bmatrix}
        AD \cr
        BC
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      \lambda 
      \begin{bmatrix}
        C \cr
        D
      \end{bmatrix}
      $$
      where $C$ and $D$ are the appropriate length and create a new eigenvector
      $$
      \bordermatrix {
          & S & T  \cr
        S & 0 & A  \cr
        T & B & 0
      }
      \begin{bmatrix}
        -C \cr
        D
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      \begin{bmatrix}
        AD \cr
        -BC
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      \lambda 
      \begin{bmatrix}
        C \cr
        -D
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      -\lambda 
      \begin{bmatrix}
        -C \cr
        D
      \end{bmatrix}.
      $$
      Thus, there exists a $-\lambda$ for every $\lambda$ so the spectrum is symmetric.
    \end{proof}


  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \subsection{Results Intrinsic to Orbigraphs}

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:ComplexEigenvalues}
      If $\Gamma$ is a $k$-orbigraph whose spectrum contains a complex eigenvalue, then $\Gamma$ is bad.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
      Suppose that $\Gamma$ has a finite $k$-regular cover $\widetilde{\Gamma}$. The adjacency matrix of $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ must be symmetric, so $\spec{\widetilde{\Gamma}}$ must be entirely real. Thus $\spec{\Gamma}$ is entirely real by Lemma \ref{lemma:SpectrumInclusion} Hence, such a $k$-regular cover cannot exist.
    \end{proof}

    Note that complex eigenvalues mean that there is an imbalanced loop.

    As in the orbifold case (reference or quote theorem) we can establish bounds on the singular set of an orbigraph via the spectrum:

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:SingularBounds}
      Let $\Gamma$ be an $k$-orbigraph on $n$ vertices. If $s$ is the number of singular points in $\Gamma$, then we have
      $$
        \frac{\sum_{i} \lambda_i^2 - n k}{k^2 - k} \le s \le \sum_{i} \lambda_i^2 - n k
      $$
      where $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of $\Gamma$
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
      \input{SingularBounds}
    \end{proof}

    Furthermore, we find that we can determine if an orbigraph is a simple, undirected, $k$-regular graph via its spectrum. Therefore, there are no cospectral singular orbigraphs and $k$-regular graphs. Whether the corresponding result for orbifolds holds is still unknown.

    \begin{corollary}
      An orbigraph $\Gamma$ is a simple $k$-regular graph if and only if $\sum_{i} \lambda_i^2 = n k$ and $\sum_{i} \lambda_i = 0$.
    \end{corollary}
    \begin{proof}
      If $\Gamma$ is a simple $k$-regular graph then there are no self loop so $\sum_{i} \lambda_i = tr(A(\Gamma)) = 0$. Additionally, note that $\sum_{i} \lambda_i^2 = tr(A(\Gamma)^2)$ via Jordan normal form decomposition, and this quantity counts the number closed walks of length $2$ in $\Gamma$. For each vertex of $\Gamma$ there are exactly $k$ closed walks of length $2$, therefore $\sum_{i} \lambda_i^2 = n k$. 

      Conversely, assume that $\Gamma$ is an orbigraph such that $\sum_{i} \lambda_i^2 = n k$ and $\sum_{i} \lambda_i = 0$. Then by the Theorem \ref{thm:SingularBounds}, we have $s \le 0$. However, $s \ge 0$ by definition so $s = 0$. Thus the neighborhood of each vertex is a $k$-star and because there are no self loops via the second condition, $\Gamma$ must be a simple $k$-regular graph.
    \end{proof}

  \subsection{Cospectral Orbigraphs}

  Here we show that some familiar methods for generating cospectral graphs can be extended to the orbifold case. In particular we extend Sunada's theorem to orbifolds.

  \begin{definition}\label{def:SunadaEquivalentDefn}
    Two subgroups $H_1$ and $H_2$  of a finite group $G$ are called Sunada equivalent if, for all $g \in G$ we have $\#([g] \cap H_1) = \#([g] \cap H_2)$.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{lemma}\label{lemma:SunadaEquivRepresenation}
    Subgroups $H_1$ and $H_2$ of a finite group $G$ are Sunada equivalent if and only if $\operatorname{Ind}_{H_1}^G 1_{H_1}$ and $\operatorname{Ind}_{H_2}^G 1_{H_2}$, the induced representations of $G$ with respect to the trival representation of $H_1$ (resp. $H_2$), are equivalent as representations of $G$.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
  See \cite{BrooksSunadaMethod} Lemma 1.1.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{theorem}\label{thm:Sunada}
    If $\Gamma$ is an orbigraph and $H_1$ and $H_2$ are Sunada equivalent subgroups of the automorphism group of $\Gamma$, then $\spec(\Gamma / H_1) = \spec(\Gamma / H_2)$.
  \end{theorem}

  Note: the proof of this theorem is drawn from a proof of a similar result for quotients of undirected graphs found in an unpublished set of notes by Gregory Quenell [ref]. %FIXME - references

  \begin{proof}
    \input{SunadaProof}
  \end{proof}

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Graphics/SunadaQuotients}
  \end{figure}

  \begin{example}
    Here we demonstrate the extension of Sunada's theorem to orbigraphs by producing two non-isomorphic, cospectral orbigraphs as quotients of a larger orbigraph. The original orbigraph $\Gamma$ we will consider is shown in Figure \ref{fig:K6WithGadgets}. The orbigraph $\Gamma$ consists of $K_6$ with one additional vertex attached to each vertex. From this, we see that its automorphism group $G$ is isomorphic to $S_6$. The action of the following subgroups $H_1$ and $H_2$ of $S_6$ on $\Gamma$ produces the two quotient graphs $\Gamma / H_1$ and $\Gamma / H_2$ in Figure \ref{fig:SunadaQuotients}.
    \begin{align*}
      H_1 &= \{ (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23) \} \\
      H_2 &= \{ (12)(34), (12)(56), (34)(56) \}
    \end{align*}
    The subgroups $H_1$ and $H_2$ are Sunada equivalent [ref buser] and so by Theorem \ref{thm:Sunada}, the quotient graphs $\Gamma / H_1$ and $\Gamma / H_2$ are cospectral. A simple calculation shows that their spectra are %FIXME - references
    $$
    \spec(\Gamma / H_1) = \spec(\Gamma / H_2) = \{ -3, -3, -1, 2, 2, 6 \}.
    $$
    They are clearly not isomorphic.
  \end{example}

  Seidel Switching is a method used to construct cospectral pairs. It has previously been used in undirected graphs, but there is very little literature on its use in directed graphs. Here we show that the method can be extended to construct cospectral orbigraphs. In its most basic form, Seidel switching produces a pair of cospectral graphs by making connections between two given graphs. 

  Suppose $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ are $k$-orbigraphs each on $2l$ vertices with adjacency matrices $A$ and $B$ respectively. Furthermore, suppose that $T$ is a \textbf{switching matrix}, that is, it is a $(0,1)$-matrix with each row and each column summing to $l$. Let $J$ be a $2l \times 2l$ matrix of ones. Then define two new orbigraphs $\mathcal{S}_1$ and $\mathcal{S}_2$ as follows:

  $$
  A(\mathcal{S}_1) = \begin{bmatrix}
      A & T \\
      T^T & B
  \end{bmatrix} \ \ 
  A(\mathcal{S}_2) = \begin{bmatrix}
      A & J - T \\
      (J - T)^T & B
  \end{bmatrix}.
  $$

  \begin{theorem}\label{thm:SeidelSwitchingSimple}
  The orbigraphs $A(\mathcal{S}_1)$ and $A(\mathcal{S}_2)$ as defined above are cospectral.
  \end{theorem}

  Remark: The standard method of proving this result [ref Brooks] relies on the fact that in an undirected graph, the number of walks of a given length originating at a given vertex is equal to the number of walks of that length terminating at the vertex. This is untrue for orbigraphs, so the well known proof is insufficient. %FIXME - references

  Note, in the following, the term ``constant row sum matrix'' is used to describe a matrix $A$ such that $A \vec{1} = k \vec{1}$ for some $k$. It is easy to show that the sum or product of constant row sum matrices is a constant row sum matrix and that the function $Rs(A) = k$ is additive and multiplicative. Similarly, ``constant column matrices'' are those in which for each column, every entry is the same. This set is likewise closed under addition and multiplication.

  \input{SimpleSeidelProof}

  Remark: This theorem can easily be extended to show a pair of cospectral covering orbigraphs can be generated for any orbigraph. (Proof is very similar, not sure we need to include it\ldots.)

  \begin{theorem}\label{thm:SeidelSwitchingExtension}
    Suppose $\Gamma$ is a $k$-orbigraph on $m$ vertices and $\cover{\Gamma}_1,\ldots,\cover{\Gamma}_m$ are $k_1,\ldots,k_n$-orbigraphs on $2n_1,\ldots,2n_m$ vertices such that $k_i = A(\Gamma)_{ii}$ and $s_{ij} = A(\Gamma)_{ij} / n_j$ is an integer. Then there exist switching matrices $T_{ij}$ such that the two orbigraphs 
    $$
    A(\mathcal{S}_1) = \begin{bmatrix}
      \cover{\Gamma}_1  & T_{12}            & \cdots & T_{1m} \\
      T_{21}            & \cover{\Gamma}_2  & \cdots & T_{2m} \\
      \vdots            & \vdots            & \ddots & \vdots \\
      T_{m1}            & T_{m2}            & \cdots & \cover{\Gamma}_m
    \end{bmatrix} \ \ 
    A(\mathcal{S}_1) = \begin{bmatrix}
      \cover{\Gamma}_1  & s_{12}J - T_{12}  & \cdots & s_{1m}J - T_{1m} \\
      s_{21}J - T_{21}  & \cover{\Gamma}_2  & \cdots & s_{2m}J - T_{2m} \\
      \vdots            & \vdots            & \ddots & \vdots \\
      s_{m1}J - T_{m1}  & s_{m2}J - T_{m2}  & \cdots & \cover{\Gamma}_m
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
    are cospectral and cover $\Gamma$.
  \end{theorem}

  This gives a simple method of finding cospectral good and bad orbigraphs:

  \begin{corollary}\label{coro:GoodBadCospectral}
    There are cospectral good and bad orbigraphs.
  \end{corollary}
  \begin{proof}
    Let $\Gamma$ an orbigraph with adjacency matrix given by
    $$
    A(\Gamma) = 
      \left( \begin{array}{cc}
        1 & 2 \\
        1 & 2
      \end{array} \right).
    $$
    Constructing a pair of cospectral orbigraphs $S_1$ and $S_2$ by switching $\Gamma$ with itself using the switching matrix $I_2$. The adjacency matrices for $S_1$ and $S_2$ are:
    $$
    A(S_1) = 
      \bordermatrix {
            & v_1 & v_2 & v_3 & v_4 \cr
        v_1 & 1   & 2   & 1   & 0   \cr
        v_2 & 1   & 2   & 0   & 1   \cr
        v_3 & 1   & 0   & 1   & 2   \cr
        v_4 & 0   & 1   & 1   & 2
      } \ \ 
    A(S_2) = 
      \bordermatrix {
            & v_1 & v_2 & v_3 & v_4 \cr
        v_1 & 1   & 2   & 0   & 1   \cr
        v_2 & 1   & 2   & 1   & 0   \cr
        v_3 & 0   & 1   & 1   & 2   \cr
        v_4 & 1   & 0   & 1   & 2
      }.
    $$
    By inspection, we see that $S_1$ and $S_2$ each have only one non-trivial cycle. In $S_1$ this cycle is $v_1 v_2 v_4 v_3$ and there are $2$ ways to traverse this cycle in either direction. However, in $S_2$ the nontrivial cycle is $v_1 v_2 v_3 v_4$ and there are $4$ ways to traverse it forward, but only one way to traverse it in reverse. Hence by Theorem \ref{thm:GoodBadCharacterization}, $S_1$ is good, but $S_2$ is bad.
  \end{proof}
