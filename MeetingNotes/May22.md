Meeting Notes for May 23
========================

Today we continued our discussion of Quenell's proof of the Sunada theorem for graphs. Colin summarized where we had gotten to last time and cleared up exactly what the theorem is counting. We started from the result that for \\( \gamma = v_0 \ldots v_n \\) with \\( g_{\alpha_i} v_0 = v_n \\), the translate \\( g \gamma \\) is closed in \\( \Gamma / H \\) if and only if \\( g g_{\alpha_i} g^{-1} \in H \\), which we all agreed was true. This then leads to the question: how many \\( g \in G \\) are there such that \\( g g_{\alpha_i} g^{-1} \in H \\). Quenell appears to claim without proof that there are \\( \\#(C(g)) \cdot \\#([g] \cap H) \\) such \\( g \\). Colin began to present his incomplete proof of this result, but he had mistaken a fact about cosets which made the proof invalid. We then worked together to formulate a new proof and worked out several examples. The Mathematica code used to calculate the examples can be found in [[here | /Mathematica/ConjugatorCounting.nb]].
