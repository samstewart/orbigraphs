Cycles and Cospectrality
========================

**Claim**: Two \\(k\\)-[[orbigraphs | Orbigraph]] on \\(n\\)-vertices are [[cospectral]] if and only if they have the same [[length spectrum | LengthSpectrum]]. *Note: this applies to any graph. For reference see Brouwer and Haemers p.200.*

**Proof**: Use Jordan canonical form.
