Sam and Colin presented their poster on topological spaces and walked through several of the proofs. Liz provided a useful example of the issues with infinite intersection using the topological space on the real line.

Colin mentioned that Brooks removed the free requirement on the parent group $G$ and instead only required $H_1$ and $H_2$ to act freely on our graph $\Gamma$.
