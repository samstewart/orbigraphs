Orbigraph Quotient
==================

The **Orbigraph Quotient** (also called the Godsil-Royle Quotient) is a process for constructing [[orbigraphs | Orbigraph]] from k-regular graphs.

Let $ \Gamma $ be a $k$-regular graph with a group $ G $ acting by automorphisms. The orbits of $ \Gamma $ by $ G $ define an equitable partition $ \pi = \lbrace \pi_1,\ldots,\pi_n \rbrace $ on $ \Gamma $. Construct a new graph $ \Gamma / G $ with $ V(\Gamma / G) = \pi $. Let $n_{ij}$ be the number of vertices in $ \pi_j $ that a vertex in $\pi_i$ is adjacent to. Then there is a directed edge in $ \Gamma / G $ from $\pi_i$ to $\pi_j$ with weight $n_{ij}$.

The new graph $\Gamma / G$ is an [[orbigraph | Orbigraph]].
