Length Spectrum
===============

If \\(G\\) is a [[Graph]], then the **Length Spectrum** of \\(G\\), denoted \\(\mathcal{C}(G)\\), is the sequence \\(l_n\\) that counts the number of cycles in \\(G\\) of length \\(n\\).

Notes
-----

A standard result is that if \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) are graphs with \\(\mathcal{C}(G) = g_n\\) and \\(\mathcal{C}(H) = h_n\\), then if \\(g_n = h_n\\) for \\( n \le \max{\\#(G),\\#(H)} \\), then \\(\mathcal{C}(G) = \mathcal{C}(H)\\).
