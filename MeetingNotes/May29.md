Meeting Notes for May 29
========================

Sam and Colin presented their refinement of the Brooks/Quenell proof of the Sunada theorem for graphs which relaxed the condition on the group action involved. Instead of requiring that the action be free, it was only required that $ \lvert Orb_{H_1}(x) = Orb_{H_2}(x) = N \rvert $ for some $ N $ that is independent of $ x $. In other words, both groups must produce regular equitable partitions.

We then discussed how we might go about getting rid of the free condition completely. It was mentioned that Quenell's second proof, using representation theory, does not appear to use the free condition. We looked at some examples to see exactly what Quenell's hypotheses regarding this proof were, and then began to discuss the representation theory equivalent of the Sunada condition.
