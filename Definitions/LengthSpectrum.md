Length Spectrum
===============

If $G$ is a [[Graph]], then the **length spectrum** of $G$, denoted $\mathcal{C}(G)$, is the sequence $l_n$ that counts the number of cycles in $G$ of length $n$.

Notes
-----

A standard result is that if $G$ and $H$ are graphs with $\mathcal{C}(G) = g_n$ and $\mathcal{C}(H) = h_n$, then if $g_n = h_n$ for $ n \le \max\\{\\#(G),\\#(H)\\} $, then $\mathcal{C}(G) = \mathcal{C}(H)$.

If $G$ is a graph with adjacency matrix $A$ then the length spectrum of $G$ is given by $l_n = tr(A^n)$.
