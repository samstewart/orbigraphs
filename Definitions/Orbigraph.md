Orbigraph
=========

A \\(k\\)-Orbigraph is a [[graph]] such that the adjacency matrix \\(A\\) has the following properties:

- Each entry is a non-negative integer.
- The sum of each row is \\(k\\).
- If \\(A_{ij}\\) is non-zero then so is \\(A_{ji}\\).

Notes
-----

- Orbigraphs can be constructed by equitable partitions of [[k-trees | KTree]].

- An orbigraph is called **good** if it is [[covered | CoveringGraph]] by a finite \\(k\\)-regular graph, and **bad** if not.
