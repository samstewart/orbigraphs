Sunada's Condition
==================

Let $ G $ be a finite group with subgroups $ H_1 $ and $ H_2 $. Then the triple $ (G, H_1, H_2) $ is said to satisfy the **Sunada condition** if for each element $ g \in G $, we have $$ \\#([g] \cap H_1) = \\#([g] \cap H_2). $$

Notes
-----
This is equivalent (for finite groups) to the statement in representation theory that $ Ind_{H_1}^G 1_{H_1} = Ind_{H_2}^G 1_{H_2} $. That is, that the representation of $ G $ induced by the trivial representation of $ H_1 $ is equivalent to the representation induced by the trivial representation of $ H_2 $.
