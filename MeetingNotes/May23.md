Sam presented his proof of spectral radius and Colin and Liz provided a small fix. Colin presented his fixed proof from the Quenell paper. We talked about the "tower of coverings" with good orbigraphs at the bottom, k-regular graphs at the midlevel, and a k-regular tree at the top. We want to find a way to quotient ourselves directly from the k-regular tree to the orbigraphs through a kind of "transitivity" of graph quotients.
