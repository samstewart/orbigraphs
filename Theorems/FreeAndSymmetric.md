Free Group Action and Symmetric Matrix
=============================

**Claim:** If \\( G \\) is a finite group acting freely on a k-regular graph \\(\Gamma\\), then the adjacency matrix of the resulting k-orbigraph is symmetric. 

**Proof:** Assume that \\(G\\) is finite group acting freely on some k-regular graph \\(\Gamma\\). We know that \\(G\\) produces a [[RegularEquitablePartition]] on \\(\Gamma\\) by [[FreeActionPartition]]. Pick any two equitable partitions \\(P_i, P_j\\) on \\(\Gamma\\) such that \\(P_i\\) and \\(P_j\\) have vertices that share edges. For each vertex \\(u \in P_i\\), let \\(m_1\\) be the number of edges of \\(u\\) shared with vertices in \\(P_j\\). We know that \\(m_1\\) is the same for all \\(u\\) by the definition of a regular equitable partition. We also know that \\(\left| P_i \right| = \left| P_j \right|\\ = n\\). Thus, we know that \\(P_i\\) shares a total of \\(n \times m_1\\) edges with \\(P_j\\). Similarly, the edges connecting \\(P_j\\) to \\(P_i\\) should be equally distributed among the vertices of \\(P_j\\) because of the regular equitable partition. Thus, there are \\(\frac{n \times m_1}{n} = m_1\\) edges per \\(v \in P_j\\). Thus, the number of edges connecting \\(u\\) to \\(v\\) is the same as the number of edges conncting \\(v\\) to \\(u\\). The k-orbigraph \\(O\\) produced by the graph quotient has a single representative vertex from each partition. Thus, every connected pair of vertices \\(\~{u}, \~{v}\\) in the k-orbigraph share the same number of edges so the adjacency matrix of the k-orbigraph is symmetric.
