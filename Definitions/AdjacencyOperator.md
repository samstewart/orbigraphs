Adjacency Operator
==================

Let $\Gamma$ be a finite directed graph, possibly with multiple edges and self loops. The vector space $ \mathbb{C}^{V(\Gamma)} $ is the space of functions from $ V(\Gamma) $ to $ \mathbb{C} $. Define the **adjacency operator** $ A_\Gamma : \mathbb{C}^{V(\Gamma)} \to \mathbb{C}^{V(\Gamma)}$ by:

$$
A_\Gamma(\phi)(v) = \sum_{v \text{~} w} \phi(w).
$$
