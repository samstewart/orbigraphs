Free Actions Produce Regular Equitable Partitions
=================================================

**Claim:** Suppose \\( \Gamma \\) is a k-regular graph and \\( H \\) is a subgroup of the automorphism group of \\( \Gamma \\). Then if \\( H \\) acts freely on \\( \Gamma \\) then the orbits of \\( V(\Gamma) \\) under \\( H \\) form a regular equitable partition.

**Proof:** From Godsil and Royle we have that the orbits form an equitable partition \\( \pi \\). It remains to be proven that this partition is regular. Let \\( \pi_i \\) be an orbit of \\( V(\Gamma) \\) under \\( H \\). Distinguish an element \\( v_0 \\) from \\( \pi_i \\). Then I claim that there is a bijection between \\( H \\) and \\( \pi_i \\) given by \\( \phi(h) = h.v_0 \\). Clearly, because \\( \pi_i \\) is an orbit, for every element \\( v \in \pi_i \\) there exists an element \\( h \in H \\) such that \\( v = h.v_0 \\). Thus \\( \phi \\) is surjective. Then assume that \\( h.v_0 = g.v_0 \\). Then because \\( H \\) acts freely, we have that \\( h = g \\). Thus \\( \phi \\) is injective.
