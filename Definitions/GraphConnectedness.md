An undirected graph \\(G\\) is said to be connected if for any two vertices \\(i, j \in G\\) there exists a path between them.

A directed graph \\(G\\) is said to be *weakly* connected if replacing every directed edge with an *undirected* edge would create a path between any two vertices \\(i, j \in G\\). The graph is said to be *strongly* connected if, without replacing the directed edges, there exist a path between any two verticies \\(i, j \in G\\).
