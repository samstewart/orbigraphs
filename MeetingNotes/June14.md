Sam presented a fixed version of his proof for reversibility and orbigraph goodness and Colin decided that the new Laplacian he had been playing with was too weak.

Liz posed the question: how does the Orbigraph's structure influence the presence or abscence of complex eigenvalues in the spectrum. She conjectured that "ring" orbigraphs with asymmetric weights produced complex eigenvalues, a conjecture we are still trying to prove.
