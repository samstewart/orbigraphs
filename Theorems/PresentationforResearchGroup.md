Presentation for Research Group
===============================

Our results:

**Spectral Radius is $K$**

**Sundada for Orbigraphs (for free from representation theory proof)**

**Fundamental Group for Good Orbigraphs**

**Definitions of Good and Bad Orbigraphs**

## Markov Chain Reversibility Characterization

**Bounds on singular points from the spectrum: ** $ \frac{\sum_{i} \lambda_i^2 - n k}{k^2 - k} \le s \le \sum_{i} \lambda_i^2 - n k $

**Better bounds for symmetric matrices**

**What is a Markov chain?**

**How does a markov chain take a step?***

**What does it mean to limit to a Markov Distribution?***

**How does our work relate to markov chain lumpability**

**What is the detailed balance equation?**

**How does the detailed balance equation relate to the structure of the graph?**

## Hard Questions
**Reversibility imply orbit cover?**

**Fundamental group for bad orbigraphs?**

**Are we out of questions?**
