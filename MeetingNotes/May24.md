Meeting Notes for May 24
========================

Sam and Colin presented their proof that an orbigraph if a free quotient of a $k$-regular graph if and only if its adjacency matrix is symmetric. From this, we came up with some new questions:

- Can the spectrum of an orbigraph tell us whether its matrix is symmetric?
- Are there pairs of cospectral orbigraphs where one has a symmetric matrix and the other has an antisymmetric matrix?

(We have shown that the answers to these questions are, respectively, no and yes. See [[this notebook | /Mathematica/CospectralSymmetricMatrices.nb]].)

This work on characterizing orbigraphs that come from free quotients was motivated by our desire to remove the free criterion from the Sunada theorem for orbigraphs. To this end, we discussed how we might go about this:

- Examine the Quenell/Brooks proof and see if the difference between the [[orbigraph quotient | OrbigraphQuotient]] and the standard graph quotient can patch the uses of the free condition.
- Look at more examples to try to find a counterexample.

To facilitate the second approach, Liz showed another pair of small groups that satisfies the Sunada condition. This example can be found on p.173 of Sunada's paper or in the Buser book.
